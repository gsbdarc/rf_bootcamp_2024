# {{ page.title }}

The `yen-slurm` is a computing cluster designed to give researchers the ability to run computations that require a large amount of resources without leaving the environment and filesystem of the interactive Yens.

The `yen-slurm` cluster has 11 nodes with over 1,500 CPU cores, 10 TB of memory, and 12 NVIDIA GPU's.

## What is a scheduler?

The `yen-slurm` cluster can be accessed by the [Slurm Workload Manager](https://slurm.schedmd.com/).  Researchers can submit jobs to the cluster, asking for a certain amount of resources (CPU, Memory, GPUs and Time).  Slurm will then manage the queue of jobs based on what resources are available. In general, those who request less resources will see their jobs start faster than jobs requesting more resources.

## Why use a scheduler?

A job scheduler has many advantages over the directly shared environment of the yens:

* Run jobs with a guaranteed amount of resources (CPU, Memory, GPUs, Time)
* Setup multiple jobs to run automatically
* Run jobs that exceed the community guidelines on the interactive nodes
* Gold standard for using high-performance computing resources around the world

## How do I use the scheduler?

First, you should make sure your process can run on the interactive Yen command line.  

Once your process is capable of running on the interactive Yen command line, you will need to create an slurm script.  This script has two major components:

* Metadata around your job, and the resources you are requesting
* The commands necessary to run your process

Here's an example of a submission slurm script, `my_submission_script.slurm`:

```bash
#!/bin/bash

#SBATCH -J yahtzee
#SBATCH -o rollcount.csv
#SBATCH -c 1
#SBATCH -t 10:00
#SBATCH --mem=100G

python3 yahtzee.py 100000
```

The important arguments here are that you request:
* `SBATCH -c` is the number of CPUs
* `SBATCH -t` is the amount of time for your job
* `SBATCH --mem` is the amount of total memory


Once your slurm script is written, you can submit it to the server by running `sbatch my_submission_script.slurm`.

## OK - my job is submitted - now what?

You can look at the current job queue by running `squeue`:

```bash
USER@yen4:~$ squeue
             JOBID PARTITION     NAME     USER ST       TIME  NODES NODELIST(REASON)
              1043    normal    a_job    user1 PD       0:00      1 (Resources)
              1042    normal    job_2    user2  R    1:29:53      1 yen11
              1041    normal     bash    user3  R    3:17:08      1 yen11
```

Jobs with state (ST) R are running, and PD are pending.  Your job will run based on this queue.

## Best Practices

### Use all of the resources you request

The Slurm scheduler keeps track of the resources you request, and the resources you use. Frequent under-utilization of CPU and Memory will affect your future job priority.  You should be confident that your job will use all of the resources you request.  It's recommended that you run your job on the interactive Yens, and monitor resource usage to make an educated guess on resource usage.

### Restructure your job into small tasks

Small jobs start faster than big jobs. Small jobs likely finish faster too.  If your job requires doing the same process many times (i.e. OCR'ing many PDFs), it will benefit you to setup your job as many small jobs.

## Tips and Tricks

### Current Partitions and their limits

Run `sinfo` command to see available partitions:

```bash
$ sinfo
```

You should see the following output:

```bash
USER@yen4:~$ sinfo
PARTITION AVAIL  TIMELIMIT  NODES  STATE NODELIST
normal*      up 2-00:00:00      8   idle yen[11-18]
dev          up    2:00:00      8   idle yen[11-18]
long         up 7-00:00:00      8   idle yen[11-18]
gpu          up 1-00:00:00      3   idle yen-gpu[1-3]
```

The first column PARTITION lists all available partitions. Partitions are the logical subdivision
of the `yen-slurm` cluster. The `*` denotes the default partition.

The four partitions have the following limits:

| Partition      | CPU Limit Per User | Memory Limit           | Max Memory Per CPU (default)  | Time Limit (default) |
| -------------- | :----------------: | :--------------------: | :----------------------------:| :-------------------:|
|  normal*       |    256             | 3 TB                   |   24 GB (4 GB)                | 2 days  (2 hours)    |
|  dev           |    2               | 48 GB                  |   24 GB (4 GB)                | 2 hours (1 hour)     |
|  long          |    50              |  1.2 TB                |   24 GB (4 GB)                | 7 days (2 hours)     |
|  gpu           |    64              |  256 GB                |   24 GB (4 GB)                | 1 day (2 hours)      |


You can submit to the `dev` partition by specifying:

```bash
#SBATCH --partition=dev
```

Or with a shorthand:

```bash
#SBATCH -p dev
```

If you donâ€™t specify the partition in the submission script, the job is queued in the `normal` partition. To request a particular partition, for example, `long`, specify `#SBATCH -p long` in the slurm submission script. You can specify more than one partition if the job can be run on multiple partitions (i.e. `#SBATCH -p normal,dev`).

### How do I check how busy the machines are?

You can pass format options to the `sinfo` command as follows:

```bash
USER@yen4:~$ sinfo --format="%m | %C"
MEMORY | CPUS(A/I/O/T)
257366+ | 268/1300/0/1568
```

where `MEMORY` outputs the minimum size of memory of the `yen-slurm` cluster node in megabytes (256 GB) and
`CPUS(A/I/O/T)` prints the number of CPU's that are allocated / idle / other / total.
For example, if you see `268/1300/0/1568` that means 268 CPU's are allocated, 1,300 are idle (free) out of 1,568 CPU's total.

You can also run `checkyens` and look at the last line for summary of all pending and running jobs on yen-slurm.

```bash
USER@yen4:~$ checkyens
Enter checkyens to get the current server resource loads. Updated every minute.
yen1 :  2 Users | CPU [####                20%] | Memory [####                20%] | updated 2024-06-20-07:58:00
yen2 :  2 Users | CPU [                     0%] | Memory [##                  11%] | updated 2024-06-20-07:58:01
yen3 :  2 Users | CPU [                     0%] | Memory [                     3%] | updated 2024-06-20-07:57:04
yen4 :  3 Users | CPU [####                20%] | Memory [###                 15%] | updated 2024-06-20-07:58:00
yen5 :  1 Users | CPU [                     1%] | Memory [                     3%] | updated 2024-06-20-07:58:02
yen-slurm : 11 jobs, 5 pending | 3 CPUs allocated (1%) | 100G Memory Allocated (2%) | updated 2024-06-20-07:58:02
```

### When will my job start?

You can ask the scheduler using `squeue --start`, and look at the `START_TIME` column.

```bash
USER@yen4:~$ squeue --start

JOBID PARTITION     NAME     USER ST          START_TIME  NODES SCHEDNODES           NODELIST(REASON)
112    normal yahtzeem  astorer PD 2020-03-05T14:17:40      1 yen11                (Resources)
113    normal yahtzeem  astorer PD 2020-03-05T14:27:00      1 yen11                (Priority)
114    normal yahtzeem  astorer PD 2020-03-05T14:37:00      1 yen11                (Priority)
115    normal yahtzeem  astorer PD 2020-03-05T14:47:00      1 yen11                (Priority)
116    normal yahtzeem  astorer PD 2020-03-05T14:57:00      1 yen11                (Priority)
117    normal yahtzeem  astorer PD 2020-03-05T15:07:00      1 yen11                (Priority)
```

### How do I cancel my job on Yen-Slurm?

The `scancel JOBID` command will cancel your job.  You can find the unique numeric `JOBID` of your job with `squeue`.
You can also cancel all of your running and pending jobs with `scancel -u USERNAME` where `USERNAME` is your username.

### Constraining my job to specific nodes using node features

Certain nodes may have particular features that your job requires, such
as a GPU.  These features can be viewed as follows:

```bash
USER@yen4:~$ sinfo -o "%20N  %5c  %5m  %64f  %10G" 
NODELIST              CPUS   MEMOR  AVAIL_FEATURES                                                    GRES
yen[11-18]            32+    10315  (null)                                                            (null)
yen-gpu1              64     25736  GPU_BRAND:NVIDIA,GPU_UARCH:AMPERE,GPU_MODEL:A30,GPU_MEMORY:24GiB  gpu:4
yen-gpu[2-3]          64     25736  GPU_BRAND:NVIDIA,GPU_UARCH:AMPERE,GPU_MODEL:A40,GPU_MEMORY:48GiB  gpu:4
```

For example, to ensure that your job will run on a node that has an
NVIDIA Ampere A40 GPU, you can include the `-C`/`--constraint` option to
the `sbatch` command or in an `sbatch` script.  Here is a trivial
example command that demonstrates this: `sbatch -C "GPU_MODEL:A30" -G 1 -p gpu --wrap "nvidia-smi"`

At present, only GPU-specific features exist, but additional node features may be added over time.
